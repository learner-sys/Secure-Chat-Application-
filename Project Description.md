# Project Description
In this project, we have designed and implemented a secure chat application in Python. The application provides a secure communication channel for users over a network by integrating cryptographic algorithms to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the messages exchanged between users.</br>
To ensure a secure registration process, the application implements a robust method where users can create an account with a unique username and password. The passwords are securely stored using a SHA-256 hashing algorithm. During login, the entered password is hashed and compared with the stored hash to authenticate the user.</br>
End-to-end encryption is a crucial aspect of a secure chat application to protect the confidentiality of messages. To encrypt the messages, the application employs symmetric encryption algorithms, specifically AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key). AES-256 is known for its strong encryption capabilities and is widely adopted in secure communication systems.</br>
For Integrity, before encrypting the message, hash values were attached to message. The server must verify the integrity of messages after decryption.
To exchange keys and securely establish session keys. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) was used. RSA is employed for key exchange and to establish session keys securely.</br>
In addition, we have implemented an adversary performs as an attacker listening to communication and attempting to gain access by trying to connect to the server and then send a malicious message to the server, to disconnect with client while server assumes it is still connected to the client.
